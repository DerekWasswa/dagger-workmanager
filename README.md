# Dagger 2 setup with WorkManager, a complete step by step guild

> Tl; DR Use WorkerFactory, AssistedInject, and Daggerâ€™s Multibindings we can inject dependencies into Worker class, this is similar with the way we did with ViewModel. Fully working sample project can be found here

```kotlin
class HelloWorldWorker @Inject constructor(
    private val params: WorkerParameters,
    private val appContext: Context,
    private val foo: Foo // test dependence
    // add more dependencies here
) : Worker(appContext, params)
```
